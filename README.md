# Kids Coding Crash Course
Programming course (in [Czech](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Ce%C5%A1tina)) 
for my 10 and 8 year old. The programming language is [Python](https://www.python.org/)
and the **goal** is to learn basics of OOP by building a simple 
**game** using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news).
